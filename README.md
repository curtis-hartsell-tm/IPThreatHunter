# IPThreatHunter
IPThreatHunter evaluates all the individual IP addresses from a PSR CSV export, checks their reputation classification against MDTI, and outputs all the "suspicious" or "malicious" classified IPs.

**WARNING:** Depending on the amount of IP addresses within your dataset, this script could take a long time to run (sometimes hours).
